## Supporting This Package
This is an MIT-licensed open source project with its ongoing development made possible by the support of the community. If you'd like to support this, and our other packages, please consider [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/mikebronner).

We thank the following sponsors for their generosity, please take a moment to check them out:

## Requirements
- Laravel 9.0+
- Nova 4.10+

## Installation
1. Install the package:
  ```sh
  composer require specialist/nova-map-marker-field
  ```

2. Publish the marker icon assets (this is not necessary if you are specifying
  your own):
  ```sh
  php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Specialist\NovaMapMarkerField\Providers\Service"
  ```

## Implementation
To create the map marker field, all that is necessary is the form label, and the
remaining options will have defaults applied:
```php
use Specialist\NovaMapMarkerField\MapMarker;

MapMarker::make("Location"),
```

### Coordinate Field Names
By default the field will look for `latitude` and `longitude` fields on the
model. However, if your model uses different names, you may customize them with
the `->latitude('lat')` and `->longitude('long')` methods:
```php
MapMarker::make("Location")
    ->latitude('lat')
    ->longitude('long'),
```

### Default Settings
You can specify default settings for zoom level, and initial map center
coordinates. If not specified, the zoom level will default to 12; the
coordinates will default to (0, 0).
```php
MapMarker::make("Location")
    ->defaultZoom(8)
    ->defaultLatitude(41.823611)
    ->defaultLongitude(-71.422222),
```

### Center Circle
The optional `centerCircle()` method allows the addition of a circle to be
rendered at the centerpoint of the map.
```php
MapMarker::make("Location")
    ->centerCircle($radiusInMeters, $color, $borderWidth, $backgroundOpacity),
```

### Search Provider
The underlying search capabilities are provided by
[leaflet-geosearch](https://github.com/smeijer/leaflet-geosearch). Please refer
to their documentation for provider configuration. By default we use the
ESRI search provider.
```php
MapMarker::make("Location")
    ->searchProvider('google')
    ->searchProviderKey('xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'),
```

You can specify a custom search label in the geosearch box:
```php
MapMarker::make('Location')
    ->searchLabel('Enter Address');
```

### Tile Layer
You are free to use any tile provider that is compatible with
[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.5.0.html#tilelayer). Please refer to
their documentation on tile layer URLs. By default we use tiles provided by
OpenStreetMap:
```php
MapMarker::make("Location")
    ->tileProvider('http://{s}.somedomain.com/{foo}/{z}/{x}/{y}.png'),
```

### Recenter On Nova Custom Component Events
- From your custom component you can trigger the recentering of the map as
  follows:
  ```js
  Nova.$emit("recenterMapOn", {latitude, longitude});
  ```
- You can define a custom event name that the MapMarker field will respond to:
  ```php
  MapMarker::make('Location')
      ->listenToEventName('customCenterEventTriggerName');
  ```
  You can then trigger the event from your custom component like so:
  ```js
  Nova.$emit("customCenterEventTriggerName", {latitude, longitude});
  ```

## Usage
When creating or editing you can search for an address or city to get the map to the general area you wish to get coordinates for. Then you can precisely position the marker by dragging the map -- the marker will always stay positioned in the middle, while you move the map under it.

When viewing the map in on the detail page, the map and marker are not interactive, and there is no search functionality. However, the user is free to zoom in and out.

## If you ❤️ open-source software, give the repos you use a ⭐️.
We have included the awesome `symfony/thanks` composer package as a dev dependency. Let your OS package maintainers know you appreciate them by starring the packages you use. Simply run `composer thanks` after installing this package. (And not to worry, since it's a dev-dependency it won't be installed in your live environment.)
